# **Character Origins**
## **Character Backgrounds**

Your character’s background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation
that were most formative before your character embarked on a life of adventure.
#### **Parts of a Background**

A background includes the following parts.

**Ability Scores**
A background lists three of your character’s ability
scores. Increase one by 2 and another one by 1, or
increase all three by 1. None of these increases can
raise a score above 20.

**Feat**
A background gives your character a specified Origin feat (described in “Feats”).

**Skill Proficiencies**
A background gives your character proficiency in
two specified skills.

**Tool Proficiency**
Each background gives a character proficiency with
one tool—either a specific tool or one chosen from
the Artisan’s Tools category. Tools are detailed in
“Equipment.”

**Equipment**
Each background offers a choice between a package
of equipment and 50 GP.

## **Character Species**

When you choose your character’s species, you
determine whether your character is a human or a
member of a fantastical species, such as dragonborn
or gnome.
The peoples of the multiverse hail from different
worlds and include many kinds of sapient life forms.
A player character’s species is the set of game traits
that an adventurer gains from being one of those
life forms.
Some species can trace their origin to a single
world, plane of existence, or god, while other species first appeared in multiple realms at once.
Whatever a species’ genesis, its members have
spread across the multiverse and contribute to
many different cultures.
Members of most species live for about 80 years,
with exceptions noted in the text about the species in “Character Origins.” Regardless of life span,
members of all species reach physical maturity at
about the same age. Your character can be any age
that isn’t beyond their species’ normal life span.
#### **Parts of a Species**

A species includes the following parts.

**Creature Type**
A character’s species determines the character’s
creature type, which is described in “Rules Glossary.” Every species in “Character Origins” is Humanoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear in
other books.

**Size**
Your character’s species determines the character’s
size. Individuals within a species cover a wide range
of heights, and some species include such diversity

## Page 84

<!-- source_image: srd_extract/run2/images/p084.png -->

of size that you can choose whether your character
is Small or Medium.

**Speed**
Your character’s species determines the character’s
Speed.

**Special Traits**
Each species gives a character special traits—
unique characteristics based on the species’ physiology or magical nature. When you choose a species,
your character gets all the special traits listed for it.
Some traits involve making a choice from a handful
of options.
#### **Species Descriptions**

**Dragonborn**
**Creature Type:** Humanoid
**Size:** Medium (about 5–7 feet tall)
**Speed:** 30 feet


As a Dragonborn, you have these special traits.

the Draconic Ancestors table. Your choice affects
your Breath Weapon and Damage Resistance traits
as well as your appearance.


**Draconic Ancestors**

**Dragon** **Damage Type** **Dragon** **Damage Type**

| Dragon | Damage Type | Dragon | Damage Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Black | Acid | Gold | Fire |
| Blue | Lightning | Green | Poison |

_**Breath Weapon.**_ When you take the Attack action
on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks
with an exhalation of magical energy in either a
15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide
(choose the shape each time). Each creature in that
area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus
your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus).
On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of
the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry
trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as
much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when
you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and
17 (4d10).
You can use this Breath Weapon a number of
times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

damage type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait.
