# **Monsters**
## **Stat Block Overview**

A monster has a stat block that contains the rules
necessary to use it in the game. Stat blocks are divided into the following parts:

**Name and General Details.** The name of the monster is followed by its size, creature type (along
with any descriptive tags), and alignment.
**Combat Highlights.** Armor Class, Hit Points, Speed,
and Initiative are provided here.
**Ability Scores.** A monster’s ability scores, ability
modifiers, and saving throws are listed here.
**Other Details.** The monster’s Senses, Languages,
and CR entries appear here. Additional details appear in some monsters, such as skill proficiencies,
Resistances, Immunities, and Gear. If a monster
lacks those details, entries for them don’t appear.
**Traits.** Monster characteristics that are active at all
times or during certain situations appear here.
**Actions.** The monster can take the actions here in
addition to those in “Playing the Game.”
**Bonus Actions.** This section provides a monster’s
Bonus Actions, if any.
**Reactions and Legendary Actions.** These sections
provide Reactions and Legendary Actions, if any.
## **Parts of a Stat Block**

The rules for a stat block are detailed in “Rules Glossary” and in this section.
#### **Size**

A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge,
or Gargantuan. If size options are presented, you
choose the creature’s size from those options. See
“Playing the Game” for information on size.
#### **Creature Type**

Each monster has a tag that identifies the type of
creature it is. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type.
The game includes the following creature types,
which have no rules of their own:

**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings, such as aboleths and cloakers.
**Beasts** are non-Humanoid natural creatures, like
horses and wolves, as well as most giant animals.
**Celestials** are magical creatures, such as angels and
pegasi, with ties to the Upper Planes.
**Constructs** are magically created creatures such as
homunculi and shield guardians.
**Dragons** are scaly beings of ancient origin, such as
red dragons and wyverns.


**254** System Reference Document 5.2.1



**Elementals** are beings from the Elemental Planes,
such as efreet and water elementals.
**Fey** are creatures tied to the Feywild or the forces
of nature, such as dryads and goblins.
**Fiends** are creatures tied to terrifying Lower
Planes, such as balors and hell hounds.
**Giants** are towering beings with humanlike shapes,
like fire giants and trolls.
**Humanoids** are people defined by their roles and
professions, such as mages, pirates, and warriors.
They include members of varied species.
**Monstrosities** are unnatural creatures with
strange origins, such as mimics and owlbears.
**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures, including black
puddings and gelatinous cubes.
**Plants** are sentient vegetation and fungal monsters,
such as shambling mounds and treants.
**Undead** are spirits and the reanimated dead, such
as ghosts, vampires, and zombies.

**Descriptive Tags**
A monster might have one or more tags in parentheses following its type. Such tags provide additional
categorization and have no rules of their own, but
certain game effects might refer to them.
#### **Alignment**

The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is
a default suggestion of how to roleplay the monster,
inspired by its traditional role in the game or real-​
world folklore. Change a monster’s alignment to
suit your storytelling needs. The Neutral alignment,
in particular, is an invitation for you to consider
whether an individual leans toward one of the other
alignments.
“Character Creation” describes the nine alignments and unaligned creatures.
#### **Armor Class**

A monster’s Armor Class (AC) includes its natural
armor, Dexterity, gear, and other defenses. See
“Playing the Game” for information on Armor Class.
#### **Initiative**

The Initiative entry specifies the monster’s Initiative modifier followed by the monster’s Initiative
score in parentheses. Use the modifier when you
roll to determine a monster’s Initiative. A monster’s
Initiative modifier is typically equal to its Dexterity
modifier, but some monsters have additional modifiers, such as Proficiency Bonus, applied to that
number.
If you don’t want to roll a monster’s Initiative, use
the Initiative score as the monster’s Initiative in
combat. Initiative is further detailed in “Playing the
Game _.”_

## Page 255

#### **Hit Points**

A monster’s Hit Points are presented as a number
followed by parentheses, where the monster’s Hit
Point Dice are provided, along with any contribution from its Constitution. Either use the number for
the monster’s Hit Points or roll the die expression in
parentheses to determine the monster’s Hit Points
randomly; don’t use both.
A monster’s size typically determines the die used
to calculate its Hit Points, as shown in the Hit Dice
by Size table.


**Hit Dice by Size**

**Monster Size** **Hit Die** **Average HP per Die**

| Monster Size | Hit Die | Average HP per Die |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tiny | d4 | 2½ |
| Small | d6 | 3½ |
| Medium | d8 | 4½ |
| Large | d10 | 5½ |
| Huge | d12 | 6½ |
| Gargantuan | d20 | 10½ |


A monster’s Constitution modifier is multiplied by
the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result
is added to its Hit Points. For example, if a monster
has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit
Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 Hit Points (average 11).
For more on Hit Points, see “Playing the Game _.”_
#### **Speed**

The Speed entry specifies a monster’s Speed. Some
monsters have one or more of the following speeds:
Burrow, Climb, Fly, Swim. Rules for Speed and these
specials speeds appear in “Rules Glossary _.”_
#### **Ability Scores**

Every monster has six ability scores along with
corresponding ability score modifiers and saving
throw modifiers. For more information on ability
scores and saving throws, see “Playing the Game _.”_
#### **Skills**

The Skills entry specifies a monster’s skill proficiencies, if any. For example, a monster that is very
perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A
skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability
modifier and its Proficiency Bonus. Other modifiers
might apply.
#### **Resistances and Vulnerabilities**

These entries list a monster’s Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if any. See “Playing the Game” for more
information.


**255** System Reference Document 5.2.1
#### **Immunities**

This entry lists the monster’s Immunities, if any. If
the monster has damage and condition Immunities,
the damage types are listed before the conditions.
See “Playing the Game” for details.
#### **Gear**

Monsters have proficiency with their equipment. If
a monster has equipment that can be given away or
retrieved, the items are listed in the Gear entry. The
monster’s stat block might include special flourishes that happen when the monster uses an item,
and the stat block might ignore the rules in “Equipment” for that item. When used by someone else, a
retrievable item uses its “Equipment” rules, ignoring any special flourishes in the stat block.
The Gear entry doesn’t necessarily list all of a
monster’s equipment. For example, a monster that
wears clothes is assumed to be dressed appropriately, and those clothes aren’t in this entry.
Equipment mentioned outside the Gear entry is
considered to be supernatural or highly specialized,
and it is unusable when the monster is defeated.

**Ammunition and Ranged Attacks**
A monster that requires ammunition to make
ranged attacks carries the necessary ammunition.

**Equipping a Monster with Other Items**
You may equip monsters with additional gear however you like, using the items in “Equipment” for
inspiration. You decide how much of a monster’s
equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain
and whether any of that equipment is still usable.
Beware of giving a monster combat-oriented
magic items, since those might alter the monster’s
Challenge Rating. If you do give a monster a magic
item, the monster can have Attunement with magic
items as noted in “Equipment.” A monster with

## Page 256

<!-- source_txt: srd_extract/run2/pages/p256.txt -->
<!-- source_image: srd_extract/run2/images/p256.png -->

a class tag after its creature type is considered a
member of that class for Attunement purposes.
#### **Senses**

The Senses entry specifies a monster’s Passive
Perception score, as well as any special senses the
monster possesses. Passive Perception and special
senses are described in “Rules Glossary _.”_
#### **Languages**

This entry lists languages that the monster can use
to communicate. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t communicate with it,
which is noted in its entry. “None” indicates that a
creature doesn’t comprehend any language.

**Telepathy**
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature
to communicate mentally with another creature
within a specified range. See “Rules Glossary” for
more information.
#### **Challenge Rating**

Challenge Rating is defined in “Rules Glossary,”
while guidance on using CR to plan potential combat encounters is in “Gameplay Toolbox.”

**Experience Points**
The number of Experience Points (XP) a monster
is worth is based on its CR, as detailed in the Experience Points by Challenge Rating table. XP is
awarded for defeating the monster in combat or
otherwise neutralizing it.
Unless a rule says otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or another magical ability is worth
the XP noted in its stat block.


**Experience Points by Challenge Rating**

| CR | XP | CR | XP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 or 10 | 14 | 11,500 |
| 1/8 | 25 | 15 | 13,000 |
| 1/4 | 50 | 16 | 15,000 |
| 1/2 | 100 | 17 | 18,000 |
| 1 | 200 | 18 | 20,000 |
| 2 | 450 | 19 | 22,000 |
| 3 | 700 | 20 | 25,000 |
| 4 | 1,100 | 21 | 33,000 |
| 5 | 1,800 | 22 | 41,000 |
| 6 | 2,300 | 23 | 50,000 |
| 7 | 2,900 | 24 | 62,000 |
| 8 | 3,900 | 25 | 75,000 |
| 9 | 5,000 | 26 | 90,000 |
| 10 | 5,900 | 27 | 105,000 |


**256** System Reference Document 5.2.1



| CR | XP | CR | XP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11 | 7,200 | 28 | 120,000 |
| 12 | 8,400 | 29 | 135,000 |
| 13 | 10,000 | 30 | 155,000 |


**Proficiency Bonus**
A monster’s Proficiency Bonus (PB) is determined
by its CR, as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by
Challenge Rating table, and is reflected in saving
throws, skills, and other statistics where the monster’s exceptional aptitude is a factor.


**Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating**

| CR | PB | CR | PB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0–4 | +2 | 17–20 | +6 |
| 5–8 | +3 | 21–24 | +7 |
| 9–12 | +4 | 25–28 | +8 |
| 13–16 | +5 | 29–30 | +9 |

#### **Traits**

A monster’s traits, if any, are features that are active at all times or in certain situations.
#### **Actions**

A monster can take the actions in this section or
take one of the actions available to all creatures, as
described in “Playing the Game.”

**Attack Notation**
The entry for a monster’s attack identifies whether
the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then
provides the attack roll’s bonus, its reach or range,
and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one
target unless its entry says otherwise. For details
on different kinds of attacks, see “Playing the Game”
and “Spells.”
_**Hit.**_ Any damage dealt or other effects that occur
as a result of an attack hitting a target are described
after the “ _Hit:_ ” notation.
_**Miss.**_ If an attack has an effect that occurs on a
miss, that information follows the “ _Miss:_ ” notation.
_**Hit or Miss.**_ If an attack has an effect that occurs
regardless of whether it hits or misses its target,
that information follows the “ _Hit or Miss:_ ” notation.

**Saving Throw Effect Notation**
If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect identifies the kind of save required and then provides the
save’s DC, a description of which creatures make
the save, and an explanation of what happens on a
failed or successful save.
“Half damage only” on a successful save means
the target takes half as much damage (round down)
as targets that fail the save, while also ignoring all
other parts of the effect.

## Page 257

<!-- source_txt: srd_extract/run2/pages/p257.txt -->
<!-- source_image: srd_extract/run2/images/p257.png -->

**Damage Notation**
A stat block usually provides both a number and a
die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a
hit. You decide whether to use the number or the die
expression in parentheses; don’t use both.

**Multiattack**
Some creatures can make more than one attack
when they take the Attack action. Such creatures
have the Multiattack entry in the “Actions” section
of their stat block. This entry details the attacks a
creature can make, as well as any additional abilities it can use, as part of the Attack action.

**Spellcasting**
If a monster can cast any spells, its stat block lists
the spells and provides the monster’s spellcasting
ability, spell save DC (if any spells require a saving
throw), and spell attack bonus (if any spells require
an attack roll). Unless noted otherwise, a spell of
level 1 or higher is always cast at its lowest possible
level and can’t be cast at a higher level.
A monster’s spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a green hag can cast the _Invisi-_
_bility_ spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction,
which means the spell affects only the hag.
_**Spell Components.**_ The Spellcasting trait notes
whether the monster’s spellcasting ignores the
need for certain spell components. If any spell components are required, describe the monster’s use of
Verbal, Somatic, or Material components to signal to
characters that it is casting a spell. A monster that
requires Material components has them.
_**Casting Times of 1+ Minutes.**_ If a spell has a casting time of 1 minute or more yet is listed in a spellcasting action, the monster doesn’t cast the spell in
just one action unless the action’s description states
otherwise; the monster must take the Magic action
on each of its turns and maintain Concentration to
cast the spell, as described in “Rules Glossary.”
#### **Bonus Action**

If a monster has Bonus Action options, they are
listed in this section. See “Playing the Game” for details on Bonus Actions.


**257** System Reference Document 5.2.1


#### **Reactions**

If the monster has Reaction options, those are listed
in this section along with their triggers. See “Playing the Game” for details on Reactions.
#### **Legendary Actions**

If the monster has Legendary Action options, those
are listed in this section. A Legendary Action is an
action that a monster can take immediately after
another creature’s turn. Only one of these actions
can be taken at a time and only after another creature’s turn ends. The monster can’t take a Legendary Action if it has the Incapacitated condition or is
otherwise unable to take actions.
The monster has a limited number of Legendary
Action uses, and that number is specified in the
stat block. The monster expends one use whenever
it takes a Legendary Action, and it regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.
#### **Limited Usage**

Some parts of a stat block have restrictions on the
number of times they can be used. Here are the
most common ways that usage is limited:

**X/Day.** This notation means the stat block part can
be used a certain number of times (represented
by X) and that a monster must finish a Long Rest
to regain expended uses. For example, a Reaction
that includes “1/Day” means the Reaction can be
taken once and that the monster must finish a
Long Rest to take it again.
**Recharge X–Y.** This notation means a monster
can use the stat block part once. At the start of
each of the monster’s turns, roll 1d6. If the roll
is within the number range given in the notation
(represented by X–Y), the monster regains the use
of that part, which also recharges when the monster finishes a Short or Long Rest. For example,
“Recharge 5–6” in an action means a monster can
take the action once. Then, at the start of each of
the monster’s turns, it regains the use of that action if it rolls a 5 or 6 on 1d6.
**Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.** This notation means the monster can use the stat block
part once and must then finish a Short or Long
Rest to use it again.

becomes slimy, the target can breathe air and water,
and it can’t regain Hit Points unless it is underwater.
While the cursed creature is outside a body of water,
the creature takes 6 (1d12) Acid damage at the end of
every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to its skin
before those minutes have passed.

16, one creature the aboleth can see within 30 feet.
_Failure:_ The target has the Charmed condition until
the aboleth dies or is on a different plane of existence
from the target. While Charmed, the target acts as an
ally to the aboleth and is under its control while within
60 feet of it. In addition, the aboleth and the target
can communicate telepathically with each other over
any distance.
The target repeats the save whenever it takes damage
as well as after every 24 hours it spends at least 1 mile
away from the aboleth, ending the effect on itself on
a success.

Legendary Actions
_Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after_
_another creature’s turn, the aboleth can expend a use to_

Creatures inside the cube have Total Cover, and the
cube can hold one Large creature or up to four Medium
or Small creatures inside itself at a time.

the engulfed target moves with it. An engulfed target
can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC
12 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check,
the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied
space. _Success:_ Half damage, and the target moves to
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cube. If there
